This is a mirror of http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=45

This file defines an alternative to the macro :

                          map ,kqs G?^> *-- $dG 


It comes as a command. This time, VIM won't complains about not found ^> *-- $ pattern. BTW, It also deletes all the empty lines (quoted or not) just above the signature to delete.

Older versions (for VIM 5.7) of the file define the function Erase_Sig(). 
The latest version (for VIM 6.x) defines the command :EraseSignature. 

It can also delete up to two signatures -- some mailing lists add another dashes-delimited
signature. And it keeps our signature that may be automatically inserted by some MUAs 
like Mutt.


Since v1.4: the operator-pending mode mapping '--' is defined. Hitting d--, c-- or y--
will delete, change or yank lines until our own signature (if present) or the end of the file.
